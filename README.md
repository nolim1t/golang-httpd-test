# Test GoLang HTTPD

## About

The purpose of this project is purely for learning how go build interfaces and a HTTPD API server in GOLANG.

Eventually, I'd like to use this for querying external based libraries (such as lnd / bitcoind), and utilizing a config file.

## TODO

- [ ] Configuration File support 
- [ ] Static Directory serving
- [ ] Toggle between dev and production mode
- [ ] `Dockerfile` support
- [ ] Docker buildx support to push to both github and gitlab
- [ ] Tidy up code and make this a template server
